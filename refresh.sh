# This script will ensure the starting files are up-to-date in the current branch 
# 
# It does this by fetching the base repository (the one we control) and merging 
# with it. If you have already modified these starting files then you may need
# to resolve some conflicts. 
#
# You should run this script at the start of an exercise and if told to do so. 
#
# This script can also be used to refresh a single file e.g.
# ./refresh.sh refresh.sh
# will update this script
